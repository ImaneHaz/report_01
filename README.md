# GraphProject

This project focuses on developing an intuitive and efficient tutor recommendation system to help users find the best tutors based on their preferences and create graphs. The system allows users to:

- **Enter their age** and specify filters such as mode (remote or in-person) and location to receive personalized tutor recommendations.
- **View detailed information** about each tutor, including their subject expertise, rating, age range, and mode of tutoring.
- **Access a graph plotting tool** where users can input equations (e.g., y = x^2) and specify the X and Y range values to generate and visualize graphs.

## Project Structure

The project is structured to include:

- **An API** that supports scalable and efficient retrieval of tutor recommendations based on user inputs.
- **A CI/CD pipeline** that automates testing, building, and deployment processes.
