# Requirements

## Functional Requirements
- **Tutor Recommendations**: Users should be able to input their age, preferred mode (remote or in-person), and location to receive personalized tutor recommendations.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: Recommendations should accurately match user preferences and display relevant tutor details like subject expertise, rating, and availability.
- **Graph Plotting**: Users should be able to input mathematical equations (e.g., y = x^2) and define X and Y ranges to generate graphs.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: Graphs should be plotted accurately and displayed within the specified range, with clear labels for axes.
- **User Authentication**: Users must authenticate themselves securely using a username and password to access personalized recommendations and graph tools.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: Upon successful authentication, users should have access to their saved preferences, history, and personalized features.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: The system must ensure that user data, including personal preferences and authentication details, are securely stored and transmitted.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: All sensitive data should be encrypted during transmission and at rest, with regular security audits confirming compliance.
- **Scalability**: The system should handle a large number of concurrent users and data requests without performance issues.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: Load tests should confirm stable performance under peak loads (e.g., 1,000 concurrent users or recommendations generated simultaneously).
- **Performance**: The system should return tutor recommendations and render graphs within an acceptable time frame.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: Recommendations should be delivered within 3 seconds, and graph rendering should take less than 2 seconds.

## Implementation Requirements
- **Backend API**: Develop scalable REST APIs to manage user preferences, retrieve tutor data, and generate graphs.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: APIs should be well-documented and follow REST principles, enabling smooth communication between frontend and backend.
- **Frontend Web**: Implement a responsive web interface that adapts to different screen sizes and offers seamless navigation.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: The web interface should be responsive and provide a smooth user experience across various browsers and devices.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automating testing, building, and deploying updates to ensure smooth and consistent application delivery.
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: Every update should pass automated tests before deployment, with minimal disruption to the user experience.
