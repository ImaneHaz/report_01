# Known Issues and Future Work

Several areas for future work could enhance the functionality and user experience of GraphProject. 

One potential enhancement is improving the tutor recommendation algorithm by incorporating more complex filters such as subject-specific expertise or user ratings. This would provide users with more tailored and accurate tutor suggestions.

Another area to explore is adding real-time graph plotting, allowing users to visualize changes dynamically as they input new equations or adjust ranges. This feature could improve the interactive nature of the graph tool.

Optimizing the system for scalability is also important, particularly to accommodate a growing number of users and tutors as the platform expands. Ensuring that recommendations and graph rendering perform efficiently under heavier loads will be a key focus.

In terms of user experience, continuously refining the user interface based on feedback and usability testing will help make the platform more intuitive and user-friendly. Simplifying complex workflows, improving the overall design, and adding accessible features would contribute to a smoother user experience.

Lastly, exploring the potential for integrating external data sources (e.g., tutor local data in JavaScript arrayss or educational static file serving using Node.js and Expresss) could expand the platformâ€™s capabilities, providing users with more options and a richer experience.
