# Validation

## Testing

- While unit and acceptance testing were planned for key features like the tutor recommendation engine and graph plotting module, they were not fully implemented in this version of the project. However, manual testing was conducted to ensure that the core functionalities worked as expected.
    - **Manual Testing**: The tutor recommendation system and graph plotting tool were manually tested to verify that they met the expected requirements.
    - **Future Testing**: Future iterations will focus on increasing test coverage through unit and integration tests to ensure more robust validation of the system.

-Manual Testing Process:

Tutor Recommendation System:
Entered various user preferences (age, location, tutoring mode) into the system.
Verified that the tutor recommendations displayed matched the input criteria.
Repeated the process with different combinations of preferences to ensure the system handled multiple scenarios.

Graph Plotting Tool:
Manually input different mathematical equations and defined X and Y axis ranges.
Verified that the graphs rendered correctly and aligned with the input equations.
Tested edge cases, like extreme axis values, to ensure robustness.

## Acceptance Testing

- Manual acceptance tests were carried out to check that the system met user expectations.
    - **Tutor Recommendation**: Users were able to filter tutors based on preferences such as age, location, and mode of tutoring.
    - **Graph Plotting**: Users could input equations and generate graphs based on specified X and Y ranges.
    - **Comments regarding acceptance criteria**: Future improvements will include automated acceptance tests to ensure that all requirements are consistently met as the project evolves.
